TiMiNoo ("Tee Me Noo") is a virtual cat providing minimal distraction, fully office-compatible, single button action, no sound, no death.
The cat is different on each run, its characteristics (appetite, cleanliness, cleverness, playfulness) are randomly picked at startup.

TiMiNoo has been created with busy people in mind: The gameplay is very simple and fluid on purpose, as this game is meant to be enjoyed in a work environment.

TiMiNoo is a simple yet feature-rich virtual cat, a companion for busy days: Cuddle, Feed, Educate, Wash and Entertain your very own furry companion.

Tamagotchi lovers could compare it to a Nano.

#### Kiss Cuss ![kiss](./assets/icons/kiss.png "Kiss your friends") / ![cuss](./assets/icons/cuss.png "Cuss at the naughty ghost")

When a friend appears on screen, press B to give a kiss and share the love.
When a naughty ghost appears on screen, press A to cuss at it and make it go away.
Be careful, cussing at your friends or kissing the ghost will cause you not to score points.
Every properly placed kiss / cuss will get you a sweet 1000 points bonus, so get ready and get up there.
That game goes on for 10 rounds.

### Random visits from your friends ![sophie](./assets/icons/sophie.png "Your friend Sophie") ![chichi](./assets/icons/chichi.png "Your friend ChiChi")
Sometimes, when the cat gets hungry, one of its friend will come.

TiMiNoo has two good friends: Sophie and ChiChi

- ![sophie](./assets/icons/sophie.png "Your friend Sophie") Sophie offers either a nice Matcha tea or a generous slice of a yummy homemade Coco cake. She may look like a bear, but she has a good heart and is very sweet (except when it's full moon). She lives in a big house with two bedrooms and four bathrooms,
- ![chichi](./assets/icons/chichi.png "Your friend ChiChi") ChiChi loves to cook and sometimes misses an ingredient. She will ask you for help, be a good friend and give her what she needs. Occasionally, she will be sad and simply ask for a hug. She is nice, but she likes pineapple pizza, which is weird. Actually, it's kind of illegal in Italy, so she will never travel there.
